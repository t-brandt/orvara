# Each row: mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution
# used to initialize the parameter given in the comment.  For the
# masses and semimajor axes of the companions, and for the jitter, the
# distributions used are lognormal.  In these cases the standard
# deviations are of the natural log about the distribution peak.  In
# all cases, realizations of the distributions that result in
# unphysical parameters or combinations of parameters will be
# automatically adjusted.
