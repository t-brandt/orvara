orvara
======
This repo contains orvara, the package for fitting orbits of bright stars and
their faint companions (exoplanets, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and low-mass
stars).


Installation
============
NOTE: you must have Cython installed prior to installing orvara. The following
instructions will git clone the repo, then install Cython, and then install orvara:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/t-brandt/orvara
    cd orvara
    pip install cython
    pip install -e .


Verifying
---------
cd to the root directory of the repo (if you are not already there). Run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -sv

This will run a small suite of tests. This should take about 5 minutes. If any
of the tests fail, something is wrong with the install. Maybe you recently
switched branches? Try running ``pip install -e .`` again. If the issue
persists, please submit an issue ticket on github!

Orbit fitting
=============

Configuration
-------------
First, assign the appropriate file directories and settings inside of a
config.ini file. Example configuration files can be found in
``orvara/tests/`` e.g. ``orvara/tests/config.ini``.

Epoch Astrometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: We recommend starting with ``use_epoch_astrometry = False``. If this
fails, then there is something wrong with the RVFile, HGCAFile, or (relative)
AstrometryFile. If that chain finishes fine, then set ``use_epoch_astrometry = True``.

Note that ``use_epoch_astrometry = False`` makes it so that you do not need to have any of the IAD, the gaia GOST
.csv files or anything. You can leave those filepaths as-is. I.e., if ``use_epoch_astrometry = False`` then you can ignore
everything in this subsection.
orvara will only try to load those files if ``use_epoch_astrometry = True``.


If you are using epoch astrometry (observational epochs and scan angles, ``use_epoch_astrometry = True``), you
must give paths for ``GaiaDataDir``, ``Hip1DataDir``, and
``Hip2DataDir``. Those are the paths of the intermediate epoch and scan
angles for Gaia/GOST in csv format, the intermediate astrometry from the
original Hipparcos data reduction, and from the second Hipparcos data
reduction. The second Hipparcos reduction Intermediate Astrometric Data should come from the Java Tool. All
of the IAD can be downloaded from https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hipparcos/hipparcos-2 as
a ~350 mb zip file. Or directly: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/6470227/ResRec_JavaTool_2014.zip/a58ad12e-cffb-f959-0ed5-2ae26899f61a?t=1631109433177&download=true .
Although the latter link may change.
Please point orvara to the resrec folder (the parent folder that contains all the H000, H001 etc sub folders).
For the Java IAD, this should be /home/user/Downloads/ResRec_JavaTool_2014/ResRec_JavaTool_2014/ . E.g., in a config file,
I would have:

Hip2DataDir = /home/user/Downloads/ResRec_JavaTool_2014/ResRec_JavaTool_2014/

Note: if you previously used Hip2 intermediate data come from the DVD, you will want to
upgrade to the Java Tool IAD. *Do not use* the Hip2 DVD IAD. See G. Brandt, D. Michalik, T. Brandt et. al. (2021)
section 4 for a discussion of exactly why.


Setting priors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adding Gaussian mass priors are supported. As well, bounded log-uniform priors
on the RV jitter are supported. To add a Gaussian mass prior of 1 Â± 0.1 M_sun
on the primary, you will want to add the following section to your
configuration file:

.. code-block:: none

    [priors_settings]
    mpri = 1
    mpri_sig = 0.1
    minjitter = 1e-5
    maxjitter = 1e3

``minjitter`` and ``maxjitter`` are the lower and upper bounds respectively for
the log-uniform prior. E.g. If you wanted to set a log-uniform prior on jitter
between 1 and 300 meters/second (and zero outside that prior), you would set
``minjitter = 1`` and ``maxjitter = 300``.

``mpri`` is the mean of the gaussian prior on the primary mass. ``mpri_sig`` is
the standard deviation of that distribution. E.g. for our example of a gaussian
prior on the primary mass of 1 solar mass and 0.1 solar mass deviation, you set
``mpri = 1`` and ``mpri_sig = 0.1``.

Leaving ``mpri_sig = inf`` will turn off the prior and default to a 1/m prior.

Starting conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can set the initial conditions of the orbit (starting parameters of the
walkers of the MCMC chain) via a starting file specified in the config.ini
file. There is an example starting file provided in ``orvara/tests/start_Gl758.dat``.

Usage
-----
After setting paths and MCMC (markov-chain monte-carlo)  settings in a
config.ini file, you fit an orbit by running the following from the command
line (while in the root directory of the repo).

.. code-block:: bash

    fit_orbit --output-dir /path/to/output path/to/config.ini

If you do not specify an output directory using ``--output-dir``, then
orvara will write its output files to the current working directory. One can
set the number of threads in the config.ini file via ``nthreads``. Note
that the built-in parallelization is poor, and that parallelization might not
work at all on some systems. If you get an error when running the code check to
see if it goes away when setting ``nthreads=1``. It is often better to set
``nthreads`` to ``1`` then simply run multiple instances of orvara on separate
cores.


You can access the help menu with the --help flag as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    fit_orbit --help

Output
~~~~~~
The output of the MCMC is a .fits file contained within your given output
directory (default current working directory). The name of the file will be
given by the ``target`` field within the ``[plotting]`` field of the
config file, with ``_chain000.fits`` appended (the integer will be
incremented to the next free filename). If this field is empty, the backup
target name will follow the form ``HIP%d_chain%03d.fits``.

The output file contains two .fits extensions: an empty one, and a fits table
with all the MCMC parameters at each step of the chain, together with the log
of the (unnormalized) posterior probability and some additional quantities.

HDU0: empty
"""""""""""
The first extension is empty for table data.

HDU1: table
"""""""""""
This is a fits table object. Each table column is of shape ``(nwalkers,
nsteps/thin)`` where ``thin`` is the thinning used in the configuration file (default
50, to save every 50th step). You may access a column by, e.g.,

``lnlike = hdulist[1].data['lnp']``

The column names and descriptions are:

    'mpri' : Primary mass (Solar masses)

    'msec0' : Secondary mass of the first (index 0) companion, Solar masses

    'sau0' : Semimajor axis of the first companion, AU

    'esino0' : sqrt(ecc)*sin(omega) for the first companion

    'ecoso0' : sqrt(ecc)*cos(omega) for the first companion

    'inc0' : inclination (radians) for the first companion

    'asc0' : PA of the ascending node (radians) for the first companion

    'lam0' : Mean longitude at reference epoch for the first companion

If there is more than one companion, then there are additional fields with,
e.g., 'msec1', 'msec2', etc.

    'jitter' : log RV jitter in m/s

    'jitter0' : log RV jitter for instrument 0

Note that 'jitter0', 'jitter1', etc. are present and 'jitter' is not if using
one jitter per instrument. The default is to use the same jitter for all
instruments. In this case 'jitter' is present but 'jitter0', 'jitter1', etc.
are not.

    'lnp' : natural log of the (unnormalized) probability. Note that this includes matrix determinants and is not simply chi squared.

    'plx_ML' : maximum likelihood (ML) parallax at this chain step

    'pmra_ML' : ML proper motion in RA at this chain step

    'pmdec_ML' : ML proper motion in Dec at this chain step

    'chisq_sep' : The chi squared in separation at the ML parallax at this chain step

    'chisq_PA' : The chi squared in position angle at this chain step

    'chisq_H' : The chi squared for the two Hipparcos proper motions

    'chisq_HG' : The chi squared for the two long-term Hipparcos-Gaia proper motions

    'chisq_G' : The chi squared for the two Gaia proper motions

    'RV_ZP_0_ML' : The ML zero point (barycenter RV) for instrument 0

There will be an 'RV_ZP_1_ML' for instrument 1, etc., up to the number of RV instruments.

If you want an overall absolute astrometric chi squared, you would add the
values from items 'chisq_H', 'chisq_HG', and 'chisq_G' above. There are
effectively four measurements since the mean proper motion of the system was
fit ('pmra_ML' and 'pmdec_ML').

For instance, displaying ``hdulist[1].data['plx_ML']`` will show all the
walkers for the parallax chain (however this parameter is marginalized over in
orvara, it is not fit). ``numpy.mean(hdulist[1].data['plx_ML'][:, burn:])``
and ``numpy.std(hdulist[1].data['plx_ML'][:, burn:])`` would give the mean
and standard deviation of the maximum likelihood parallax (with burn = some
integer that is the number of steps/thinning factor that you are discarding as
burn in). You should add the measurement error of the parallax in quadrature
with this particular uncertainty.

One can use the 'lnp' column to compare the likelihoods of the best orbits if a
certain posterior is multimodal. Assume that the marginalized posterior in PA
is multimodal, with a mode at a value > 180 degrees, and a mode at a value less
than 180 degrees. The following code would print the likelihoods of the maximum
likelihood orbits at each of those two modes.


.. code-block:: python

    tt = fits.open('my/path/chain.fits')[1].data
    logl = tt['lnp']
    pa_data = (tt['asc0']*180/np.pi) % 360
    ls180 = pa_data < 180
    g180 = pa_data >= 180

    print(np.max(logl[ls180]))  # the max log likelihood of all orbits with PA of ascending nodes < 180 degrees
    print(np.max(logl[g180]))  # the max log likelihood of all orbits with PA of ascending nodes > 180 degrees


Examples
--------
To run a quick test using the test data and test config.ini in orvara/tests,
you could cd to the root directory of orvara, then run the following

.. code-block:: bash

    fit_orbit orvara/tests/config.ini --output-dir ~/Downloads

This will create a .fits file in the Downloads folder. The MCMC should
terminate in less than one second because of the short number of steps
indicated in the example config file.

The end-to-end tests in test_e2e check that the code is converging to
previously accepted values for HIP3850. If you wanted to run the code yourself
on this test case and check the results yourself against those in
misc/Diagnostic_plots.ipynb, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    fit_orbit orvara/tests/diagnostic_config.ini --output-dir ~/Downloads

The diagnostic_config.ini has the same parameters as those used to create the
plots in Diagnostic_plots.ipynb

Plotting
========

Usage
-----
Once a .fits file from the output of the MCMC is generated, you can produce
several plots of an orbit by running the following in the command line in the
root directory of the repo. To do this, specify the path to the .fits MCMC
output file within the configuration file.

.. code-block:: bash

    plot_orbit path/to/config.ini --output-dir /path/to/output

You can access the help menu with the --help flag as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    plot_orbit --help

Configuration
-------------
Main plots orvara is configured to produce from the orbital fit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Astrometry orbit of the companion
2. Radial Velocity (RV) orbit over an extended time baseline
3. RV orbit over the observed baseline with O-C
4. Relative separation of the two companions
5. Position angle between the two companions
6. Astrometric acceleration or proper motion fit to Hipparcos-Gaia Astrometry
7. A density plot showing the predicted position at a chosen epoch

To generate any of these plots, simply set the corresponding parameters under
the ``[plotting section]`` in the config.ini file to a boolean variable ``True``. If
``False``, a plot would not be produced. 

Here, for 1. Astrometry orbit plots, you can modify the ``predicted_years``
parameter to plot random predicted epoch positions on the Astrometry plot. 

For 2. RV orbit of the companion, you can choose to plot a specific instrument
(by name) or all of the RV instruments by changing the ``Relative_RV_Instrument``
parameter to either the name of the instrument or ``All``. 

For 6. Proper motion plots, you can plot the proper motions
in RA and DEC in one plot (``Proper_motion_separate_plots = False``) or two
(``Proper_motion_separate_plots = True``). In general, you can also set a
customized range of epochs you want to plot, as well as number of orbits
sampled from the posterior distributions and the resolution (step size).

Other outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In addition to the six plots, you can check convergence of fitted parameters in
the HDU1 extension by setting the parameter ``check_convergence`` to ``True``. You can
define the length of the burn-in phase, note that the parameters are sampled
every ``thin`` steps (as set in the configuration file; default 50). And
you can save the results from the fitted and inferred parameters from the HDU1
extension with ``save_params = True`` in the ``[save_results]`` section, with
an option of setting the quantiles for the uncertainties.

Color bar settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To color-code orbits with a key, choose a colormap from the matplotlib list of
colormaps (default viridis) and a reference scheme for the colorbar. Three
reference schemes are available: the eccentricity as ``ecc``, the secondary
companion in jupiter mass as ``msec_jup`` and the secondary companion in solar mass
as ``msec_solar``. Use ``use_colorbar`` to toggle the colorbar key on and off
with ``True`` or ``False``.

Multiple Keplerian orbit fits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the case of a 3-body or multiple-body fit, you can plot the results for each
companion by setting ``iplanet`` to the corresponding companion ID used in the
fitting. ``iplanet`` starts from ``0``.


Examples
--------
To plot orbits, run the plot_orbit command. We can use HD4747 as an example.
First, run the orvara fit, then the plotting, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    fit_orbit --output-dir ./orvara/tests/chains orvara/tests/config_HD4747.ini

    plot_orbit --output-dir ./orvara/tests/plots orvara/tests/config_HD4747.ini

plot_orbit will plot the chain given in the ``McmcDataFile`` in the config
file. If you want the results from a different chain (e.g. a second, different
fit of the same star) you must update this parameter to the new file.
